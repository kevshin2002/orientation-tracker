I'm not sure why you would be interested in running this code because I made this specifically for myself, and not for others. Despite that, if you insist, I've provided all of my conda dependencies in **environment.yml** and **requirements.txt**. 

I suggest the paper for a higher level understanding. If you're a C++ geek like me, then you can reference my codebase and make comments on how unreadable and overly abstracted it is. This was done in 4 days, so please do give some understanding. 

Enjoy.

Hopefully I'll make this codebase more cleaner and finish the panorama problem.

Thanks
Kevin
